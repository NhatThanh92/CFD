This projet using Coupling WRF/FLUENT to simulate the complex terrain
the coupling between the meteorological model, Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF), and a
commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software, FLUENT, is developed. 
The WRF is used to provide velocity profile inlet for unsteady boundary conditions for FLUENT. 
In FLUENT with higher resolutions and techniques such as Computer Aided Design (CAD), Finite Volume Method, and
several turbulent models as Large eddy simulation (LES) and Detached eddy simulation (DES) combined with the appropriate boundary condition
could provide wind field simulation results in more accuracy.
